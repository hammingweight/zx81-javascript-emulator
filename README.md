# zx81-javascript-emulator
A fork of Simon Holdsworth's *JtyOne* JavaScript Emulator for the Sinclair ZX81.

## History
Between 2003 and 2006, Mike Wynne wrote a C# emulator, *eightyOne* for the Sinclair ZX81 that was notable for its realistic rendering of the ZX81's graphics. Unlike most other emulators of the time, Wynne's emulator could reliably render pseudo high-resolution games like Forty-Niner. In 2006, Some Holdsworth ported the emulator to Java (*JtyOne*) and in 2015 he ported the emulator to JavaScript.

The source and executables for `JtyOne` can be found in the [legacy directory](./legacy).
